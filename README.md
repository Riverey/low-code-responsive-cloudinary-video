# Low Code Responsive Cloudinary Videos

This library provides a simple way to implement responsive Cloudinary videos with lazy loading support. It utilizes Cloudinary's powerful image and video transformation features to optimize video delivery based on the viewport size.

## Attributes and Behaviors

| Attribute              | Required | Description                                                                                                                  |
|------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| r-video_id             | Yes      | The ID of the Cloudinary video.                                                                                              |
| r-video_breakpoints    | Optional | Comma-separated list of breakpoints in the format "minWidth/videoWidth". Defaults to predefined values if not specified.    |
| r-video_cloud-name     | Optional | Cloudinary account's cloud name. If not provided, it should be set on an element with the attribute "r-video_cloud-name".    |
| r-video_autoformat     | Optional | Enables or customizes Cloudinary's automatic video format conversion. Default is "f_auto".                                  |
| r-video_autoquality    | Optional | Enables or customizes Cloudinary's automatic video quality adjustment. Default is "q_auto".                                  |
| r-video_lazy-load      | Optional | Enables lazy loading of the video. Default is false.                                                                         |
| r-video_autoposter     | Optional | Automatically generates a poster image for the video. If not provided, the library generates it based on the video's width. |

## Cloudinary Transformers

Cloudinary transformers allow dynamic transformation of images and videos. This library utilizes these transformers to adjust video format, quality, and size based on the viewport or element width.

## Finding Cloud Name and Video IDs in Cloudinary

- **Cloud Name**: The cloud name associated with your Cloudinary account can be found in the Cloudinary dashboard settings.
- **Video IDs**: Each video uploaded to Cloudinary is assigned a unique ID. You can find the video ID in the Cloudinary dashboard or via API.

## Implementing Responsive Cloudinary Videos in Webflow

To implement a responsive Cloudinary video in Webflow, use custom elements with a `<video>` tag. Optionally, you can create a `<source>` tag inside the `<video>` element, although it will be auto-generated by the library if not provided.

## Lazy Loading Support

This library supports lazy loading of videos. You can integrate it with lazy loading libraries like [vanilla-lazyload](https://github.com/verlok/vanilla-lazyload) for efficient loading of videos based on user interactions.
